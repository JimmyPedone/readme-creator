# readme-creator

## Description
Hello! My task was to create a readme generator that allows the user to create a README through node.js.  This application provides excellent reusability for software engineers to prompt themselves with questions from "inquirer" that allow provoke consistent and professional README.md's.

I had issues with getting the licensing to render as a seciton, this is definitely something I would like to work on for a resubmission in the future!

I'm proud of what I've made, and plan on using something like this for my professional career.
